# Whitelist_Dapp

# In this project we have created a Dapp named Whitelist.

Which allows it's users to join the Whitelist by connecting a crypto wallet to the site.

Once a user with a certain address joined the Whitelist, the same user can't join with the same address.

The maximum number of users who can join our Whitelist are 10 as specified in the contract.
